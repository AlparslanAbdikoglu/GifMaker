# GifMaker
My first Python file thx to DevED youtube tutorial (video is in my youtube channel) alparslan abdikoglu

SO  
with this program you can make a gif out of any video 
you just need to install 2 dependencies and change the abst path! Make sure the video is in the same folder as the python file.
